## Pattern selection in models of visual development

My research focuses on the development of neuronal selectivity in the primary visual cortex.
The large-scale visual cortical organization in many species follows a quantitatively precisely defined common design.
Can this design be explained by an optimization principle for brain architecture?
To answer this question, I developed a symmetry-based approach to exhaustively classify potential optimization 
principles and analyzed their predictions for visual cortical architecture.
I achieved this using methods from pattern formation theory.
I found that only a tightly constraint subclass of principles can account for the observed common design.
