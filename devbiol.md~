## Statistical analysis of cell morphology and cell intercalation

I am studying morphogenesis in the Drosophila embryo. 
Here I am focusing on the dynamics of cell contacts during such morphogenetic transformations.
From a dynamical systems perspective, I am particularly interested in 
whether and how the involved cells are actively coordinating their behaviors in order to achieve morphogenetic 
transformations efficiently.

## Morphogenesis in Drosophila embryo

## Large-scale image analysis

The quantitative answer to these questions demands analyzing large numbers of cells.
I am therefore using large-scale image analysis from in-vivo fluorescence time-lapse microscopy of intact embryos 
and assemble data sets in which the collective behavior can be quantified in thousands of cells.
