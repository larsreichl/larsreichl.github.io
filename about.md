I'm a research scientist at the [Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self Organization](http://www.ds.mpg.de), Göttingen.
A theoretical physicist by training I applied methods of statistical physics and data analysis to various areas including 
high energy physics, neuroscience, and developmental biology.

## Research Interests
I studied physics with a focus on high energy physics and cosmology.
After my diploma I oriented my research interest towards theoretical neuroscience.
During my PhD I focused on the development of neuronal selectivity in the primary visual cortex.
The large-scale visual cortical organization in many species follows a quantitatively precisely defined common design.
Can this design be explained by an optimization principle for brain architecture?
To answer this question, I developed a symmetry-based approach to exhaustively classify potential optimization 
principles and analyzed their predictions for visual cortical architecture.
I achieved this using methods from pattern formation theory.
I found that only a tightly constraint subclass of principles can account for the observed common design.
In my postdoctoral research I am studying morphogenesis in the Drosophila embryo in collaboration with 
developmental biologists.
Here I am focusing on the dynamics of cell contacts during such morphogenetic transformations.
From a dynamical systems perspective, I am particularly interested in 
whether and how the involved cells are actively coordinating their behaviors in order to achieve morphogenetic 
transformations efficiently.
The quantitative answer to these questions demands analyzing large numbers of cells.
I am therefore using large-scale image analysis from in-vivo fluorescence time-lapse microscopy of intact embryos 
and assemble data sets in which the collective behavior can be quantified in thousands of cells.
My expertise includes neuroscience, mathematical modeling, scientific data analysis, and biophysics.
